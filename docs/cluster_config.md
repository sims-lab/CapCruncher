# Set-up a Snakemake profile

This is not essential but it will make running the pipeline much easier by submitting jobs to the cluster automatically and using pre-set parameters.

**Note:** Cookiecutter is required for this step. This can be installed using `pip install cookiecutter`.


### For SLURM based clusters:

``` bash
# create config directory that snakemake searches for profiles (or use something else)
profile_dir="${HOME}/.config/snakemake"
mkdir -p "$profile_dir"
# use cookiecutter to create the profile in the config directory
template="gh:Snakemake-Profiles/slurm"
cookiecutter --output-dir "$profile_dir" "$template"
```

### For SGE based clusters:

!!! warning
    This has not been tested

``` bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/snakemake
cd ~/.config/snakemake
cookiecutter https://github.com/Snakemake-Profiles/sge.git
```

### Example SLURM profile:

```

**Note**: The singularity-args are required to mount the data directories into the container. e.g.

``` bash
singularity-args: -B /ceph  -B /databank
```

Gives the container access to the `/ceph` and `/databank` directories on the cluster. The current working directory is also mounted into the container by default. You can add additional directories by adding more `-B` flags. Obviously this will be different for each cluster so you'll need your own defaults. The `$TMPDIR` is also mounted as this causes errors if not. The `--cleanenv` flag is also required to prevent the container from inheriting the environment from the host.
