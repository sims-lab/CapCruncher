CapCruncher documentation
########################

CapCruncher is a package explicitly designed for processing Capture-C, Tri-C and Tiled-C data.
It consists of a configurable data processing pipeline and a supporting command line interface
to enable fine-grained control over the analysis. Unlike other pipelines that are designed to process
Hi-C or Capture-HiC data, the filtering steps in CapCruncher are specifically optimised Capture-C, Tri-C
and Tiled-C datasets.
