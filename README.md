## Analysis software for Capture-C, Tri-C and Tiled-C data.

CapCruncher is a tool designed to automate the processing of Capture-C, Tri-C and Tiled-C data from FASTQ files. The package is entirely written in python and  consists of an end-to-end data processing pipline and supporting command line interface to enable finer grained control. The pipeline provided is fast, robust and  scales from a laptop to a computational cluster.
